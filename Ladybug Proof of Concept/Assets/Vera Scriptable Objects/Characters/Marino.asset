    relationshipDescription: "Was in \u201Cbusiness\u201D with Theodore\u2019s late
      father. His crime family partnered with one of Hampshire\u2019s business enterprises
      years earlier-- Hampshire would give the mafia cover jobs as a way of hiding
      their suspicious incomes and make them seem like average working class members
      of society. Marino \u201Cworked\u201D at the business for  years-- until he
      left the family; Due to his time with the Hampshires, he got close to their
      family."

    relationshipDescription: "Along with her, Marino helped raise Theodore. The two
      don\u2019t often directly interact, but Eleanor finds him rather repulsive due
      to his history. The two share a subtle respect for one another, though, due
      to having both been close to Theodore\u2019s parents.\n"

    relationshipDescription: 'Marino sees her as a blessing in disguise. She could
      be his link to one day seeing the spirit of his old partner again. He treats
      her very well because he thinks it will help his chances. He often asks her
      for private seances.
