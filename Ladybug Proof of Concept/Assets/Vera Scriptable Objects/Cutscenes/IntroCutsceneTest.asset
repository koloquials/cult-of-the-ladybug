    - "Despite the life you\u2019d lived, you never expected yourself front and center
      of the scene you now inhabited."
    - When you answered the beck and call of an old friend, someone who last surfaced
      during your university days, you imagined Theodore would want to catch up over
      lunch in a cafe.
    - "You imagined when he\u2019d hired you instead, that it would be over some marital
      dispute or business spat. That was your usual line of work. "
    - But no. Everything about this was strange.
    - "An opulent table, carved of wood unimaginable to your commission fees\u2019
      paygrade, felt cool to the touch as your clasped hands set themselves upon it. "
    - You noted the polished gems and neatly printed, what, tarot cards? Strewn about.
      For a moment, you ignored the other guests encircling the setting, focusing
      on your task.
    - "Tonight, you were tasked with observing each of Theo\u2019s friends here. He\u2019d
      said something about wanting to get to know them better. "
    - This odd request gained your doubts, but who were you to turn down money for
      a skilled service?
    - "You\u2019d done precursory research on them, but Theo had wanted you to do
      more work here at the seance. Unorthodox, but it wasn\u2019t like you got out
      much.\n"
