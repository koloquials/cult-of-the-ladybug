    - Heads up, the character portraits here are part of a test for cutscenes, they
      aren't actually talking to you right now.
    - You were invited to Hampshire Manor, a mansion in the woods, by the wealthy
      Theodore Hampshire.
    - 'He was planning on throwing a dinner party and seance with a group of his close
      confidants. '

    - You arrived when the lights suddenly went out, and when they came back on, Theodore
      was dead. You must interrogate guests, inspect your surroundings and accuse
      the right suspect.
    - 'To talk to a guest or inspect an environment object, press ''e''.

      When talking to a guest and the interrogate symbol appears, press ''space''
      to start the interrogation.'
    - When talking or inspecting, a text line might appear in yellow. This means it
      is key information--a clue. Clues are recorded and will help when you want to
      accuse someone.
    - You will only be able to interrogate them in a certain order. Another interrogation
      will become available once the last one is completed.
    - To accuse a guest, click on the accuse button. Then, select a culprit and a
      clue, then hit accuse. Good Luck!
