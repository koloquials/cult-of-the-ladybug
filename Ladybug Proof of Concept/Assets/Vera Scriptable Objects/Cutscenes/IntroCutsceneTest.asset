    - "Despite the life you\u2019ve lived, you never expected finding yourself front
      and center of the scene you now inhabited."
    - When you answered the invitation of an old friend, someone who last surfaced
      during your university days, you imagined Theodore would want to catch up over
      a casual lunch.
    - 'Then he hired you, and you imagined it would be over some domestic dispute
      or business spat. That was your usual line of work. '
    - But no. Everything about this was strange.
    - 'An opulent table, carved of wood unimaginable to your paygrade, felt cool to
      the touch as you set your hands upon it. '
    - You noted the polished gems and neatly printed tarot cards strewn about. For
      a moment, you forgot about the other guests around you.
    - "Tonight, you were tasked with observing each of Theo\u2019s friends here. He\u2019d
      said something about wanting to get to know them better. "
    - This odd request gave you doubts, but who were you to turn down money for service?
    - "You\u2019ve done light research on them, but Theo wanted you to do more at
      the seance. Unorthodox, but it wasn\u2019t like you got out much.\n"
