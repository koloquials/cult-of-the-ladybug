    - Hey Diego, this is a test of the new Cutscene functionality I worked on on Thursday/Friday.
    - It works based off a list of scenes containing actors, their moods, and their
      lines of dialogue.

    - I can manipulate who's talking, signify when, and eventually we'll have some
      nice cutscene art made by Rachel!
    - For now this is it though, the rest of the game is the same as of this build,
      but finishable!
    - I also locked the accuse menu depending on information gained, and changed the
      underlying system for how unlocking information works.
    - Its all implemented the same, but today and tomorrow is when I'm going to be
      changing the mechanic behind it in a noticeable manner.
