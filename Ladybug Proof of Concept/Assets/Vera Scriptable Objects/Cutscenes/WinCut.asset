    - 'Fine. '
    - Fine. You've won your little game.
    - 'I killed my darling, my dearest Theodore. '
    - Eight times I pierced him through, for the eight times he's betrayed my trust.
    - We started this because I wanted to find something to live for again, to truly
      make me feel something.
    - The promise of attaining that "something", that's what Theo said he'd bring
      me through all of this.
    - This is our eighth seance, and I still don't feel any different in the slightest.
    - Just now, the one who lied and lied and lied to me, he's gone. He's dead. Goodbye.
